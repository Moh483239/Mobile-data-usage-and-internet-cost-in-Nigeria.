**SATISFACTION RATING**


The satisfaction ratings reveals an interesting pattern among respondents. The majority of users selected rating 3, showing that most people feel neutral about their network provider-not fully satisfied, but not extremely disappointed either. Ratings 4 and 5 follow at a distance, suggesting that while some users enjoy good service, they are far fewer compared to the lower group. On the lower end, only a small number of respondents chose rating 1 and 2, meaning very few people are strongly dissatisfied. Overall, the data shows that network providers are doing “just okay”, but there is clear room for improvement. A stronger focus on reliability, speed, and customer support could shift users from neutral to genuinely satisfied.
